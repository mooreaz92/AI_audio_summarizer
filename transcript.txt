 The crew lived on the fight. After the excitement of the battle, the party took stuff off of the body, piled up outside the asses-arce, which include three knocked out people, and the dead body of Mielon Hask. After coming up the goals from the four of them, Cousin really offered to be a treasure of the group, which there were surprisingly little put back. L. them buried Mielon behind the end, while the others got witness statements inside. When everyone goes up to the rooms, chat wonders why L is bearing Mielon, but not the others rebodies. Damon takes a bath before bed, because in real life, he's trying to confer people in the end, and L. sleeps in the woods behind the end all night. In the middle of the night, he hears Zuck and the others leaving down the road. The next morning, the party meets back up in the counter room with the end to eat a wondrous continental breakfast, which included a quiche. Damon approached an attractive person at breakfast and asked if he knew anything about the rooms of Cardiff. He very much did not. Cousin really asks Ausky if she knows who's the work at the bar, if she knows anything about the rooms of Cardiff. She doesn't know anything about the rooms, but does say there has been some trouble with yields from farms in the direction of the rooms. As the party departs, the asses-arce, Cousin really asks the siphonist willing to get in into a horse and carry the party, siphonist very much unwilling, and just keeps on walking. As the party walk towards the rooms, they go into an area with a lot of farmland. There's so many small farm stands along the road, selling fresh spring greens, eggs, jam, other such. All of a sudden, as the party was walking along, they heard and then saw an orc case-boyous warm of locusts with a pitchfork, shouting more damn pests where you all come in from. As the party approached the locusts, they noticed that they simply dissipated. The party met the farmer, Graylish, who revealed that he had been misled by several storms with destructive predators over the last several days. He also revealed that he is a homesteader and that he and his family's entire livelihood is tied to the farm. After a bit of questioning, the party learns that there is a farmer nearby who is doing very well for himself, Josiah Butler. Josiah is also the only other farmer in the area besides Graylish, who sells strawberries. The party decided to walk to the Buckler Farm and try to suss out Josiah. As the party approached the farm, they saw many people working in the Buckler Farm and construction on a new home, quite close to the existing home, which was already quite large. Just as the party came up to the door, one of you heard Josiah talking with someone angrily telling them to return the grandfather's farm that night to finish the job. The party knocked on Josiah's door and claimed to be land surveiers coming to check out the property. Unfortunately, land surveiers had come out just a few weeks prior, so Josiah was quite skeptical of the claim. Nevertheless, he let you look over his land. Because of what you have used drop down when the run begins Josiah's doorstep, you decide to go back to Grayish, who is born for a good old stakeout. Shortly before sundown, a swarm of rats appeared and started going after Graylish's strawberries. The party learned that siphon hates rats. The several party members began fighting the rats, including siphon calling forth a falkon to vinkwurst them. Alan Muralo though, heard some laughter behind some rose bushes on the far side of the farm. They moved that way and then attempt to destroy the swarms of their source. Elf and an undrushedness, known there, laughing maliciously. A swarm of bats was called forth as well. Ultimately, the party prevailed and their battle against the gnome and their swarms incapacitated the gnome. So your now all at farmer-graylishess farm, you knocked out this gnome who called forth the swarms. And as this happens, the auto gnome in the party perhaps a deep feeling of robotic empathy becomes a zombie. At that exact moment, Krill will become unzombified because pop-up echoes and the answer comes to that. The farmer is a zombie. So that actually brings up a good question. Is it always like a time of day strikes and everybody who, like it can be inconsistent? So is it like a time of day type of thing where this happens consistently or is that just a happy little accident? That's a happy little accident. Oh my god. So actually you might be shocked that sort of happened at the same time. Krill came to and shut down for a day. Guys, I think chat ran out of battery. Now let's see how a reboot went. All right, so the gnome is unconscious, right? Yes. Have we tied up the gnome yet? Nope. I've got some ropes. I'm going to go tie the gnome up. Cool. What's everyone else? And all those little swarms have dissipated, right? Yeah, everything's clear. The feeling is fine. Once you incapacitated the gnome. Yeah. They all push. I know. Well, I'm going to jump with excitement that are lovely. Who else is here? I'm not she's back. I'm going to also maybe, didn't we have a rope tied to her to keep her? I'm going to take that. I'm going to untie you. I'm going to untie that to the chat. That's very funny. What the fuck is this? Yeah, so we're going to have her going to work on that. Oh, honey, we just want to make sure we didn't lose you. I didn't even consent to this, but OK. Oh, that's funny. So I can't do it. I guess we should check the pockets of the gnome. Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm going to L-search. The gnome is incapacitated, right? That's one mountain pike. Oh, I loved it. I love to serve. I'm keeping the eye on, maybe sure you're not pocketing the other side. All right, so, what's the arrow for that? Um. And we did not, we have not had like a long restaurant anyway, right? No. Is that a quiet squeaky toy? Or is that just how she looks at it? That's just how she looks at it. Oh, OK. That was squeaky toy. Wow, it's a squeaky toy. It's a quiet squeaky toy. I want that. They would probably do really well if you invented like a... Well, so there's a dog toy that does do like squeaks that only dogs can hear? Yeah. And I was like, that is so good. Because so if you love to sleep in a dog, it looks like the squeaks. So you should do like an investigation. Oh, yeah. Oh my god, you found a squeaky toy. Oh, that was a natural one. Oh, I had a investigation. All right, so you wouldn't really don't find anything. Even things that are in like plain view, basically what happens is you roll the name body over. And so they like... Oh, God's in there. You're like looking at the gnome and you miss things that are... They're a person just because you keep rolling them over. Well, I don't know y'all. I just don't see anything. Can I go investigate? I'll go investigate. Yeah, I'm going to just assume that I'm on time. John, do you have a pencil? Yeah, should be the one in that like yellow and white straight thing. I got a 19. Cool, so Crilla, you wake up and immediately find a quarter-staff. I'm the known fat. How could you miss this? I just thought that was part of the ground. Sibing is glares. Cousin merlot. You know what eyes are a little bit older? Okay. So I know our friend here is tied up and we probably need a little bit more information. Should we like slap them a few times? Or throw some water on them? Yeah, might be throw some water on them. And before we do that problem, we should come up with... Should we question them and ask... Like plan to ask who he works for? Who feels the most intimidating of us? Oh, me. That's a great question. Well, well I don't know, maybe we get like a good cop bad. Oh, okay. The situation, not that I... I'm not a big fan of cops. Yeah. I was probably nodding on right there. I still don't like the law. I knew we had something to calm my friends. Oh my gosh. I love that you went from cops to the law. Yeah. I also don't like the law. Oh yeah. Oh no. I like the law. Oh no. Well, I'm not intimidating. Well clearly I have good cops. Does anybody have intimidation? Yeah, I was intimidated. Not me. Nope. Wow, we're all just very nice. Oh, very nice. Well, that's three on intimidation. Oh, you're intimidating. Yeah, I have plus one. Oh, well then there you go. I have plus zero. Oh, okay. All right, there you go. Well, we're calm for this, clearly. Okay, okay. So I'm gonna take my... Just like dip my fingers in my like water skin. Just like like this. And then follow it up just like slap. Yeah. Oh, you're right. I'm going to... Oh my gosh. Sorry, I just felt. I know. Um... Please, please. Here we go. Okay, let's see. So, I'm gonna cast... Can you cast... Two... Can't, I can't breathe. Yeah, at the same time. If you're not in combat. There are technically six seconds, of course. Okay. Okay, well, first I'm going to cast the omotors. And make my eyes change color and flicker to be red. And then six seconds later, I'm gonna cast the omotor again, which makes my voice boom up to three times as loud. And I'm gonna say wake up. I'm gonna also give Damon a guidance. So you get a D4 to roll on any per check. Can I do that as well? Yeah. Also give guys, sorry, I'll give guys two. You can just... Doesn't mirror left. So, okay, y'all, we'll get wake up to you. Your eyes are red. Yeah, cousin mirror left on my side. Maybe play guys like I just kind of stand on the back. Take her teeth with her dagger. Wait, so who's good cop? Not cop. I think I'll cast a bad cop. Yeah, I love bad cop. Bad cop, worse cop. And inherently cousin mirror left on my back. Yeah, bad cop, loud cop. Demon. So I just listen to this gnome. It's a self. Immediately passes right the fuck back out. You have two from the water. And then gets slapped. And then sees the part in doing all this. Uh-huh. Your eyes are red. So you've said wake up. Okay. What were you doing with the girls? Um... Roll for shit in yourself. Roll constitution check. Roll constitution check. Yes. Um, I was... I was just nodding my own business here. Uh, uh, uh, you know, I'll be extrayella. I'll come clean with all of you. I was here just to steal a couple strawberries. And then out of nowhere, these breasts and these bats appeared. I don't know where they were coming from. And anyone can roll like, um... Yeah, we can link these to the rats. Yeah, please. Okay, I'm seven. Actually, I never roll. I can roll these like check with advantage. Okay, because this is a horrible lie. I have a net. 21. 21. Seven, I got it. We just killed another one. So all of you know that this is a wall-based lie. Yeah. And I was a small high. And that they created the fucking small size. Yeah, we can link them to... Marla's gonna take her dagger that she's filling with and slam it down next to the side of this norm's head and say, Oh, I'm sorry. There was a bug right there. Um, I'm sorry. I don't think there was actually. I can tell. Every natural creature around here, I... I'm sure you can, but you know, I've got such good vision. So, um... Can you watch her name, friend? That's a wonderful one to us. Dash a wonderful one to us. I'm just gonna tell you, Dash. Dash a wonderful one. Dash a wonderful one. Dash a wonderful one. Dash a wonderful one. Dash a wonderful one. Can we tell if this knows being truthful or not? Like, is that a real name? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it should be a real one instead of check. It's like bullshit. That's the whole thing. 21. 22. Jesus. No, that's great. 13. You're a dummy. Um, it's the most I think of in unstopage. Okay. I'm learning. I don't know why. Dash a wonderful one. Now, can I, can I get real close and I'm gonna speak a little like soft terms? I can't, I can't level review. I think, you know, my friends here know that you are, um... Let's say, just about the total bullshit. So, um, here's how this is going to go. Right. You're gonna tell us exactly what you've been doing with Mr. Buckler and why you're here. And we'll let you leave with most of your fingers and your toes. Now, this can go a lot slower. It's gonna go a lot quicker. It's really up to you. And then you'll like gulps. Dash a gulps. Okay, fine. I'll tell you what you want to do. Josiah Buckler hired me to destroy all the folks in the area, especially the ones growing. We're props. So then Josiah has monopoly on them and can make a lot of money on it. Where's your money, David? That's such a good question, my friend. I'm just imagining a scout half-way going then. Where's the money? Where is she? Oh, roll that sensation. Where's the money? Yeah. With guidance, right? With guidance. And then whatever you might have. And then I get plus one to 19. And then roll the d4th. So 22. Yeah, different quickly. Now, it's sat my home, of course. Where might that be? It says in some woods. On the other side of the Buckler property. Sorry. I think it might be time to... Oh, that's right. And I'm going to take my knife and I'm just going to kind of like gently go towards that peak. You're like, don't do that! So some woods on the now Northeast South. I told you. I'm the other South of the Buckler property. What will other side can be a lot of things, right? I'll walk into it. I'm going to also like step up. I'm a... His Josiah hired others like you. Oh no, it's been on me. Just you. I'll cast joy dozens of farms. I doubt it. If we were able to stop that easily. Wait, is Josiah Buckler a farm? Yes, he owns like a big farm. Like a farm. Um... Okay, fine. Take us right now and we're going to sleep at your place, too. That's actually a great idea. Um... A prolarsial sister's won't like that, though. Yeah, and you're going to explain to them what you've been up to. Okay. Can I roll some... Are the really brothers and sisters, can I? Yeah, you can roll. And then... That's 13. Um, you're skeptical. You're not talking about this. So you're not talking about this. Um... Before we do that, I think we just need... So let me get this straight. Josiah's been... I'm sorry. Buckler's been... Oh, just Josiah Buckler. Whatever. Buckler's been... Roll around shield man. Hi, yes. It's been hiring you to ruin other people's farms. Yes. Uh, thank you. You've been leaving the money back home. And... What's... What happens when all the farms are... Has God hasn't been awfully like... Is there anyone else who has skills like you? Like... Well, uh... Not to my knowledge. And what is the local law enforcement like? He's not that I'm a fan, but... Who controls this area? Let me sort of take care of each other around here. Oh, clearly, yes. But uh... Yeah, we don't have much to share. But uh... The... The reach to the level. Share a pen lock. Share a pen lock. Share a pen lock. And is he also on Buckler's payroll? Uh... Not quite. Not quite. Not quite. Hmm... What they think they're friends? Yeah. So my friends... There... There's a few ways I think we can handle this, right? We've got... Are you kind of coming back to us now? Yeah, I think I know what you're saying. I'm curious y'all all kind of stand around. Yeah, I'm gonna maybe move us away from him, but so that he can't over here or... Like, kind of like... Yeah, I've also had a view on him. We're having a little chat here. We're having a little chat here. But I have a small part. Yeah, let's make sure he can't run away or... I'll watch him, yeah. Um... So... Few different things. One was we could just go and fuck up Buckler's shit. Right. Um... We have this as evidence. Two we could maybe wreck the letter back to the King, just let him know what's going on in this area. There's a sheriff. You know, I don't know if I necessarily trust that. Or we can also go back to Graylish and bring this... Person with us and just say here's the situation that we found. Here's what's going on and just kind of leave it to the local farmers to organize and, you know, rally against Buckler. I am hesitant to go and destroy Josiah's crops because there's already been a crop shortage because of his actions. And so destroying those crops I think would further lead to further scarcity for the food for this region. But one thing we could do is maybe take Josiah's farm and redistribute it to the farmers in the region. Maybe we could set up a co-op situation. Yeah, you'll have some similar mindsets, don't you? And then we could take like a percent of that. She's a branding. You know, we could collect fees. We can kind of set it up as my co-op. A membership? A subscription to that? Maybe it's the delivery column. So... I think... It always happens to you. We'll call it a day. Oh, I think my commenter just warns me. But I have mid-sentence. I think that we should have him take us to his place because he did say it's near Josiah's farm and, you know, interaction. We can collect what Josiah has paid him. We can rest up. I don't think we should go banging on the walls at night. And then take him to Josiah's farm tomorrow and have him kind of own up to what was going on. And take the farm and food distribute. And then we can be on our merry-day. I like to have an option where we just turn him into the other farmers and then have the other farmers do what they want to do. I do think we should bring them in. Like maybe we go there first. We can get them organized and bring a home kind of militia to Josiah by the way. I was going to say I just fear that they're not strong enough to just I clearly have money right now. So I feel like he could get some mercenaries or something. But there's not a need for notice. Yeah. And we can kind of sneak up to his place. So it just kind of comes down to me. Yeah. I vote for going to Graylish first with this with Dax and then maybe we can rest up. And then we can visit nighttime. And I could use arrests. Yeah, I could buy myself a rest lots of rats. Yeah, I know I've been sleeping right now. I can cast in tango and carry ones at the first level. I don't think so. So we're resting. We're going to the other farmer that we made. I think we're going to Graylish. Because we're on Graylish's farm right now. So it's the closest farm anyway. Yeah. It's Graylish's farm big enough for like we could do right up and kind of crash there. Yeah, it's a big old farmhouse. It has a barn. It does actually. Nice. And sleeping barn. Okay. And then we're going to redistribute the land. Nice meeting you. I'm under that. I see opportunity in that. Sure. Do we? I mean, we could keep a little portion. And have ourselves a little farm way. So this is going to be like it. We're going to do a charter then. And then hand titles to people. Or I think first. And then is the share of cannon for we need to get the share of our. I want our campaign to get us launching a farmer's market. Yeah. Yes. Or is it? Yeah. I have subscription. It's a little good square farmer's market. It's called Hello Farm. It's a little bit fresh. I think the managers fresh. They're pretty fresh. Don't worry. They're curious. They're curious. It's not worth a pear. I think we probably should talk to Crelish first. And then we could build a lot of like our work. Yeah. Because then we can get a better sense of like the numbers and stuff. Right? I'm going to just pick up this half now. Kind of by. Full now. Full. Oh, huh. I altar this full now. I'm just kind of like grabbing by like the back row. Just kind of pick them up. They make this amazing. Does anyone want this quarter staff? Because I have one already. I also have a quarter staff. Just put them together. You're like a half staff. It's just like waiting all the time. Oh, it's just like waiting all the time. That word. All right. So you all are going to go to the Grelishens? Yes. It's waking them up. Yeah. Yeah. We'll come to the door. Maybe like 30 seconds or so. And we'll open it up inside. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll open it up inside. Oh. You all. What are you doing here? who's that? At the points of the actual. It's kind of holding up. Yeah. I think we found the problem with your, remember those pests, the pest, the probably, the cause of the pests that have been eaten by crops. Well, that just looks like a no. Can we come and spot a war there? And I want to zombie anymore. Yeah. Yeah. And... Oh, yeah. You were on, you were on time. My name is Krillin the Killin. Yeah. Krillin, you couldn't meet you. You may need to sit down for what we've just had. Yeah, come on in. I'll have the wife cook up some eggs and some coffee if you'd like. Oh, that sounds great. Yeah. Just shoot your DJ. I prefer tea. It's got to be scurvy, like. Oh, yeah. So we sit down and maybe... Maybe. Graylish wolf will not excelsate cold, cold, cold, it's wise to say. I'll rip! So come down, sort of coming down the stairs and say, why? And I'll say, we have guests over that of, that have solved our problem and she'll immediately... Oh, yes, come on in. Yeah, you've saved our farm. Thank you so much. And she'll sort of beckon you down and go and get some eggs and coffee. Don't start. Okay. Oh, that's really nice. So I'm going to kind of fill Graylish down. See, so we caught this gnome creating magical groups of pests that were feasting on your crops. And he's admitted to us that he was hired by Josiah Buckler. And he's been doing similar things to other local farms in order to benefit Josiah Buckler's yield and kind of drive up the price that he can charge for his products. So we've got a couple ideas of how to deal with this. But we wanted to let you know and see if you had any thoughts. And you see Graylish as your time. It's just a good problem. From my sort of friendly, the excited that you've solved the problem to yourself and great age. At last, or Josiah? Probably Josiah. I knew there was something wrong. I knew it. You just didn't connect with the rest of its farmers. You know those. So that's a slide. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. What, uh, do you all plan to do anything about the situation? We were. Yeah. Well, what's your thoughts on the sheriff? Sheriff Hamock. Yeah. Do you think he would be helpful? No. No. Why is that? I mean, Sheriff's appointed by. That's that government. You know, we're pretty sparse out here. Just what farmers doing. I don't think the sheriff will hope so much. How many collect we are? Like, we can't talk about numbers. How many farmers are there? Well, the standard acreage on the farm around here is. 52 acre plots. I mean, most of us just have one. We just have one plot like me. Most of us around here. Besides Josiah Butler, who has about 2000 acres of. Oh my god. So anyways, we're, uh, I don't know, I guess in the immediate area, there's about. 20 or less. 20. And Josiah employs a lot of people in his farm too. You have any sense of how many people work on that farm? Are you friendly with the workers? Well, the, uh, I keep employees about 20 people. I'm friendly with many of the workers because they used to have their own farms. So, uh, it's sort of been forced to farm for Josiah. Can I talk to my companions for a second? Yes. I'm a sidebar with y'all. Girlish. Okay. Listen, here's my take. We got a religion that we got and stopped at you. I feel like we figured out the source, right? We can go and collect our feed. It's kind of up to the farmers to do their organizing work and handle this as they see fit. That's, you know, kind of my perspective where I'm coming from. But I'm also, oh, I agree. You know, it's bullfrog. All right. But they have the strength to, should we stay and try to help them organize a little bit to get the, get the ball rolling a little bit so they can actually have the strength to drive Josiah out. Yeah. What if we rally all the farmers together in the morning? And then we get them. We just like, we lay out what we found. We say, here's, here's what we think you should do, but, you know, with it. I don't know. Tomorrow morning we seize the means of production. So I think a few of us are, you know, inspirational in our own ways. What if we gather them all together and we share the situation, kind of, rile them up. And we take our little friend here back to their place to kind of collect our, our, our organizer fee. And we can also like, you know, I can aspire heroism of people. It seems like y'all can pass guidance. Maybe we, we just kind of, and you just yuk the crowd a little bit. What do you think about that? I agree. That's not right. They're a battle for them. Yeah. And if we don't get to the bottom of this age of destruction, they're going to be a tornado that kills the cops. That's the answer. Yeah. Let's get them together. Let's let them know what we found. And then, and then, and then, because they deserve it now. Yeah. Pass that. It's time for what they want to say. We have so could right the king and let him know the situation that we've been redistribution. I like that. Yeah. And maybe we, we asked him to, came Solomon to send out a, like, a couple armed force that's big enough to come and assist the farmers. Just to be like a wellness check and a couple, you know, like, you know, like, couple weeks. We'll get you the way back. Yeah. Now. Because I'm trying to find John's map, but. Oh, I'm the sport. Yeah. Because it would be on our way back, right? Yeah. Now, my big friend, if you feel really strongly about this, you can just split the party. Two of us go back. Go to the work and get the call. We have a two-fold crowd. Wait, where are we now? We're at Buffalo farm. That was kind of the farm where that. That's just north of the. So we're like, kind of like right here. So between the garden and the acid sards. Got it. Okay. And they're like, I was like, did we make it all the way to the top of the hole? We overshot it. Oh, yeah, that's, I forgot to label that. That's supposed to be like a main road. That's okay. It's like whole shit. Nice. Tardo has the library, right? Yes. It's like a little bit. That's fine. It's a good, good. Yeah, I think we should definitely collect our fee. I'm for that. I'm for that. I'm for that. I would like to kind of jazz up the farmers. Make sure that they at least like, you know, like in my neck of the woods, we had this, this inspirational leader, Bertie Sanders, who would just come. I'm just coming. I'm just coming. Like, you know, give some speeches, some local politicians, draw a big crowd. Take back the things. Yeah, and kind of like, like have like a little like, you know, like a rally. We're going to fly off to other places. But, you know, it really kind of excited the folks. Brought us together. So maybe we kind of have a Bertie Sanders approach and kind of rally these farmers together. Can you be an outlet? Yeah, Bertie Sanders doesn't know. Do you know Bertie Sanders? Yeah, no, I don't think it means. Oh, oh. Yeah. Can we get a long rest so we're here too? You could say that my name? Yeah. And maybe is there a way that, um, Graylish has of like contacting the other farmers, like, kind of overnight or like, you can ask them. Yeah, Graylish, do you have any way of kind of talking to some of these other small farmers? I'm going to kind of bring them up to us, be on our kind of plan. Do you have any way of kind of like reaching out to any of the workers or farmers and maybe some of the workers who used to have their own farms who are now working for Jones Island that, any of that you would only want that you would trust, though, not any of that you would. So maybe the only ones that you really know are strong. Yes. Well, I can rally the troops as they say. I appreciate your help with firing them up. I don't think it will take much, but we'll be back at my house that, we'll say, maybe 6 a.m. Start the day a little late, let people sleep a little bit. That's fine. And then, I don't know, fight with them not. And you're free to stay either here. We've got a cellar that you can stay in. No, no, we'll open bedrooms, but we have this living space as you just want to sleep on the floor. But then we also got a barn if you want to make beds up a hay. Yeah, I'll take some barns. Yeah, I'll take some hay. Alright. I'm a little scared of rats on this day. Maybe a star can curl up on the next cellar or on a fire. So, you've got to get to a cat, my friend. I got my Falcon. Oh, that's fine. I've probably been about an hour or so. I was like, you guys have a cat. You're not going to find one. My friends would be like, it's a backseat or something. Alright, so Simon is staying in the living room in Raylicious Farmhouse. Everyone else is sleeping in the barn. They have mostly pigs and chickens in the farm. That's okay. And you all get a long rest. And we'll say all of you get back, go back to the Raylicious House in the morning, except for Simon who's interrupted, like sleep is interrupted with farmers just starting to walk into the house. What's the demographic of the farmers? Are they all tiny people? There's, let me say, about three or four orcs, three or four humans, three or four half, just like sort of a big old mix. I'm going to kind of start, like, I like up and still sleepy. But I'm going to start talking to them, just kind of chit-chatting about the situation. Let them know what we found, kind of get like a, you know, try to be favorable. But then I'm also going to start asking if, ask around if anybody knows anything about the rental car. Or, and I'm also going to kind of show them our map and maybe see if they have any other top areas that they would recommend on the Chinatown. Or recommendations. Yeah, I mean like, yeah. What's good around you? Any ends with like five stars. Do you know anyone that works there? I probably want to handle Dachel Will, y'all or take a look. Oh, I'm going to tie, so Dachel's still tied up. Hmm, it's a good call. Do we want to like have somebody on watch? No, I don't want to. And that's what you offer. I feel like we can ask the husband and Mar-a-Low when she put it back. Or how about that salad? I can imagine. Does the seller like buy any chance? Yeah, it does. Okay, then here we go. Before we go down there, maybe, or before we put them down there, can we just go down and make sure they don't like weapons or anything that he could get a hold of? Yeah, come. You know, I don't actually sleep. I mainly just use like a trance. So like, I could go down there with them and just chill out for a bit and see if he like ever tries to make an escape or something. Maybe like, have a little baller or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If there's any trouble, just bring that and I'll head down. Exactly. Okay. Can we do that? Sure. So we can just retound that. At a certain point in the night, Dachal does not register. But they do look around and find an old bottle of wine. And they start drinking it. Al, do you prevent that from happening? Or are you going to enter a trance or are you going to let Dachal? I'm going to take it from him. That's probably not his wine. Good idea. So you take it from Tron, Dachal and they go. Come on, come on, you seem like you seem so. Like a chicken soul. What are you saying? Well, you just let me have this wine yet. No. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. We got a big day tomorrow. You're facing trials. You're facing the drugs. I'm facing the drugs. I thought you said your face is dry. Your face is dry. Be better. All right. And now we'll say that they sort of wake up in the early AM. Bring Dachal up. And some of the farmers, as they roll in, they're like, a little bit of a stowel. And a little bit of a stowel. So they know Dachal? Not really. They're like familiar, but not, not that I'm really like friends or even acquaintances. No Dachal is like, but they've heard of it in my, I'm not close by. Oh. Okay. Do they know if Dachal has siblings? They probably would. Okay. I'm going to inquire as to Dachal's homestead. And if there's others there. Cool. So we're going to go to Simon's question first. Talking to all the farmers about the ruins of Cardiff. And what you hear from many of them, is that they say that the quality of moonlight is very interesting there. The quality of the moonlight. A couple of them have been there just to sort of see what it's like. Not much there, kind of boring, but the moons, though, is really bright. Okay. So it's like a strong presence. Yeah. Okay. Do they just walk by it or what's their interaction with the ruins? Yeah. They just like sort of, a few times out of like Cardiff on, so they've like gone to like, see what they're like. But it wasn't. You get the sense that they were really bored. They like, which they didn't make the trash because it was boring. Just one of them said, just like a pile of stones. It's not the nails. But the moon was kind of pretty. Okay. And then we'll go, cousin, you most farmers were like, not dash up, wasn't that many siblings. They're a long wolf. They've been out there for years. So the thing is, okay. That's something we're probably playing. Oh, we dropped it. Okay. So the farmers are all there. And I'd turn our questions, which is super nice of them. Yeah. And they're like, some of them are talking about like, wins, wins, wins, wins, wins, wins. Okay. We're going to do a birdie sander, is the impression of nerves. Can I go for that? Who wants to speak to this farmer? I could cast heroism at first level maybe like twice, and that'll keep them from being, that's like, amuse them with bravery, essentially. So... The type in is not most charismatic of folks. You can give her the shot. I mean, she not cares about you. Well, I mean, Marla's a professional. Marla's a professional. Marla's also, you know. She's like, I mean, are you cares about her? Slightly. Like how slight. I have a plus three to persuasion. Okay, well. But only a plus one of performance. Plus one to charisma, which puts me 14. Okay. And I have plus one to persuasion. Okay, plus six to performance. Jeez. Oh, you should just do it. Because what do we want to do? We just want to let them know what happens. And then like, right over time. Leave it right all the way up all the way back. Just say you are many. And, you know, he is one. Let's get rid of the power of the collective. We can, someone so incestuous. Here's some minutes. Marla will get in front of the farmers and cast. Cast minor illusion, in which I can create like a sound. And she's going to create like a steady like. Like a war drone. Yeah, like a war drone sound. So I've been carrying a like fan. Like quarter staff. Jumping here. Oh, you're good. She has four drums going in. She'll show you how to dance. She's like, hey, can you give me a voice boom over here? If, if, David is a little boy with a voice and, you know, speak to the farmers and, you know, cut say. I'm going to be a fellow fellow farmers. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This land is your land. This land is our land. From the roots of Cardiff. To the, to the, to the, to the, to the. Yeah, that's a great question. Is there a name with a C in the? Yes, you know, to the Easter C. Yeah. And while she's going through this, she's going to. To be casting heroism twice on like the two people that seem like the biggest from this like farmers. And I'll take those two spell slots. If y'all want to do guidance, right? Yeah, I'll pass. Yeah, I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. I'll pass. Also. Oh, a bless. One of the bigger ones. Okay. Wow. Just give them. I'm gonna cast a pass without grace. So 10 of them have a plus 10 advantage to remedy. Wow. We're really. No, I got to ask. I'm going to do that like right before they leave itself. So they have 10 of those. Damn, could with all the stuff we're doing, can I get advantage on this roll? Uh, yeah. Oh, 19 plus 6. Five. Five. All right. So, so the farmers are so fucking powerful. I'm ready to go. They're like, What's fucking buckle is that? Watermelons screams. And they actually just fucking start spritzing out the door. They're like, There's like not much coordination. And Graylicious like, Before he leaves just says, Thank you again so much for what you've done. Let's get on. First frame. Just spread our name. How about that? They don't have a name. Oh, yeah. Didn't we come up with a name? We didn't come up with a name. Well, we didn't have a name. We didn't use a name. I thought we came up with a name. I'm not talking. Calamity. Calamity. Calamity crashes. Calamity crashes. What? What? What? Calamity cuties. Oh, I like Calamity cuties. Okay, we're going there. Spread our name. We're the Calamity cuties. Come on, come on. What? One thing that does happen is Dash will attempt in the middle of this To say, Yeah, that's getting old! That's like tries to run out like as if they were a part of the game. I feel like Dash will still tie off the map. Yeah. They're going to run tied out there. So do we need to try to catch, like, do it. Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, That's the way Dash will need to do it. I have to check to see. I have to. Well, he's just kind of a higher gun, right? I mean, he actually says, So you don't need to do anything. That's all it's time to do that. And then just follow the phone. Oh! Oh! Shhh! Side-in puts like his clutter staff on his back. And then, And, but I'm going to pull him up on my friend. I believe that you have a house to leave us to. Oh, yeah. Hey, if I'm to leave you, I need to be able to walk. I just pick him up and I might even tell us. He's like, I think my rope tied up and it's like, Yeah, like water down. Yeah, I put him on like my stick and just kind of pull him over my backpack. I kind of was like, yeah, like stick. Or it's like rabbit to me where he like pulls. Okay, we're turning this way. Cool! So, Dasha will re-blocked him. Leigh and you to their house. No. What's this like? And it is past Josiah Bumble's house. Can we see it? What's his walking on fire? Oh, so, I hope Josiah Bumble is like old farmhouse and the new one under construction. Just like these flames. Oh, shit. All's well that ends well. Mission completed. Heroes. Cue these. Cue these. And you hear just like the farmer saying, like laughing and like, and you hear the voice of Josiah Bumble, they're just saying, as you go and buy. No! Is the fire kind of spreading or does it look like it's pretty well just contained to his house? Yes, it is. Okay, cool. It's so wonderful. Serarseness, but there's smart benefits. Yeah. Okay. It's just too intensive music. Well, it is on fire. I thought you were going to say that. You walk out of that little scene down on the music to changes. Right. The out of combat music. Oh, that's okay. Oh! Oh, my gosh. Can't wait for the translation of that. Yeah, that's really interesting. Sweet. All right, well. We did it. We solved the farm crisis. All right, so that was a good question. To give you to their place, but she's just like tiny plant in sort of these woods. And they have like a lot of like sort of log benches around. They have like a small fireplace. They have like a small, a cultivate garden. And they also just have these like a few bronze sculptures. That stand out to you when they're like, sort of just like in front of their house. And that's like very, very much what you would expect from like a new druid. And then like vines grow on the house. And they're like coming inside, going inside, but the money's inside the house. Can we detect any kind of traps or anything? Yeah. Any security systems? Yeah, can we ask him about the bronze statues? That's why I don't trust him. Yeah, can we do some investigations? I'm going to take them off by a mess there. And then the bronze statues, same. I'm scared. You made him sound sketchy. Yeah, so you guys can all investigate bronze statues. Oh. Can I cast? Oh, detect magic. Oh, yeah. That's a ritual. Oh, 19. Oh, my God, six. What? This is investigation. Oh, I knew it was not. Oh, my God. Wow. All right. So, I see no. So I've been knows that the statues are of exceptional quality. And that they're probably quite expensive. And Damon, you know that it's well. And you even know our participant that each of these four bronze statues is worth around 300 gold. It was a few or the five places to sell them. And they're sort of various, just like sort of mystical creatures. It's like a unicorn. Like their shapes and the marrota. Yeah. Wow. This might detect magic. Read yield anything? And your detect magic. There's the magic. Okay. Come with it, Chris. So I don't know what we want to do about these statues. Maybe we'll put a pen on our map. But these are worth some money. Hmm. I don't know. Well, she'd also say they're smallish. So they're like, oh, it's very good. It's how we could carry them. Yeah, I'd say, I'll set 10 pounds each. Where does you get these statues? Where did I get them? Well, they're made in Tartan. They're made in Tartan. Okay. I'm going to be, uh, they're all the finest crafts come from. Hmm. But where did you get them? I mean, Juzanna procured them for me, so. So these are your pigments. Oh, it was. Yes, it was my whole pigment. That was such a lie. That was such a lie. That was a lie. Was it 19 on mine, such a... Well, he wrote terribly. So, so, uh, we'll just say you all now. Yeah. These are lying. But, uh, that's also... I wonder, are there any windows around the outside of the house? Well, anyway, just like, here in... I want a peek in. Yeah. I would like to sneak up and see if I can make a peek in. You peek in and, uh, the only thing that, like, is surprising is that there's so much, like, plant life growing inside. Uh, and it's actually dirt floor. So, so... Okay. It's like a hut. Yeah, like, really, it's like the only difference to outside, is that there's like a roof and like, solid walls. Oh. So, it's like a... Okay. Side-in's a big fan of this place. A lot of, uh, like, a terrace type thing. Okay. Cool. So, where's the moon? Woo! Woo! It's up! It's what the Rude of Aga? And we'll just point to, uh, point to a corner of the hut, where you see wild-rude baga growing. Interesting. Can I sniff this, Rude of Baguah? Does it bite the malloy, regular, Rude of Baguah? Uh, do, uh, do an nature check. Uh, 18. Nice. It smells like, like, particularly delicious food. Mmm. Mmm. Maybe it's valuable. Yeah, I'm gonna ask him. So, what's the, this Rude of Baguah? It smells pretty, uh, what are you, what are you using it for? For what? How have, what are you using it for? Well, I'm just gonna, uh, I'm gonna ask him, what's the, uh, this Rude of Baguah? I'm gonna ask him, what's the, uh, this Rude of Baguah? Uh, what, what it, it seems like it's been cared for very, but wow, I'm gonna be being grown this. I mean, I am, uh, I'm a druid now. It's a fellow druid, yeah, this is, this is, this is nice work. Well, well, key, the key, to the growing and, and most farmers can have it with a grasp of this, but, but not quite to the extent that it's actually the soil. Oh, the soil is, is, this is, this is too far. Oh, okay now. Yeah, and so, uh, you do all the watering, you've got a lot of stuff, but, but, but the most important thing, is picking up soil. Uh, so here, and between two small hills, and so all of a sediment comes, comes down, with the nice nutrients for the peps. Where's the money? It's all due to the river being here. Go get it for us, please. Now, do you want us to, it seems like you've put a lot effort in this riddle baguio, do you really want us to just dig it all up? Well, that's where the money is. So if you like the money, you need to get the money. I feel like the riddle bagio is valuable. But of course, I mean, it is, it is valuable. Can we have the riddle bagio? I'm gonna, so, are you sure you want to dig up the money? This whole situation. Yeah, we can take the riddle bagio. Yeah, because you still, you still got, you still got your farm land. Like, so I'm gonna kind of sidebar. Yeah, sidebar we should take the riddle bagio. We should take the riddle bagio, take most of the money, we'll leave them with the riddle in the morning. We're taking the stash here. Like, we're not gonna decimate him. He's just, you know, I'm trying to make a leaven too. You know, I'm always looking for an opportunity and I kind of smell an opportunity. You might, if I go talk to him. Yeah. Okay. Dashy, dashy, can I call you dash? Yeah! Now, I'm kind of wondering, you're aware of your situation, right? Like, we, I think so. Okay. We don't want to have to kill you. Oh, no! Okay, bro, I'm so, I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm just going to say to him, what's your motivation? What are you looking for? What are you looking for? Yeah. I live for, I live for the riddle bagio. I was acting too, to feed, I should know, to eat. To have really, to have some bro's, to my ear. Okay, so you, you really like, it seems like you really like yard art. Yes. Okay. So, you're like, what are your skills, like your druid? Can you make like potions or pulses? Like, do you have any work? I'm just really looking for your value as human beings. I can summon Swalves of Christchurch. We did. We did. And it's certain individual creatures as well. All right. Any that are good at like delivering mail? No, no, do you get like, homing pigeons or like? No. No, okay. I'm not a copy. If I had trams and some pigeons. All right. I've got a bunch of pigeons there. You don't mind pigeons that much? Yeah, cause I don't know. There's not, there's not much I'm getting out of here. Yeah. Well, we should, I'll tell you this. I'll tell you this. If you leave me here, we're just, we're just 50 gold. I'll be fine. Hmm. Why don't we send them to the school? We'll, how about this? We will leave you here with your 50 gold. We're taking the statues. We're taking some of your rutabaga. We're taking the rest of the gold. And in exchange, you help these surrounding farmers to make sure that they are able to prosper and they're doing well. You seem to have a very good understanding of local soil sentiment levels. Maybe I'm making sure that all of these farmers also are understanding that. This kind of be, take some pride in your community. Use your set of, instead of destroying, up left. Roll a roll persuasion set. Straight 14. Yes. That sounds like a great idea. No, no, no. Deal, so. And a national book. Oh, yes. What? The customs? She can. It's like, oh no, you're going to tie. She just like, oh. Like the boss. Like the boss. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Cool. I'll give the gold over to Merla, because Merla is her treasure. How much do we get? So you find like a little, a little wooden box, buried with the root of Vega. That was quite disappointing. And has like worms in it and like little crippers. But you do find 350 gold. Okay, so literally. We're leaving 50 behind. We're leaving 50 behind. We're going to take a couple of the root of bagas. I'm going to hold on to it. They're delicious. Anybody else wants some root of bagas? So we take 300 gold. And then how many statues are there? Four. There's four. But what are the creatures? Yeah. And you said unicorn. Yeah, one, one's a unicorn. One is like a, a fake creature. And one is a dragon. And the last one is another sort of fake creature. Well, these might be a little too happy for me to carry, especially from carrying all the skulls. I'll take one or two of them. I'll give one to the other people if I want to hold on to someone. I'll give one to the other people. Do we think we can get like chat to like chat? Like a little. Yeah, let's just put them inside chat. I feel like I'll take two and check and take two. Yeah, I can you note those down. Yeah. Do you know? We open them in chest. Yeah, just because they're stories. After we upgrade them. Yeah. I imagine them on like wheels, sores. Yeah, it's a way of hard. Yeah, it's a way of hard. But we can get like a, like instead of bag of holding, like just have a bag of, like, a card. Yeah, just a card. Like a whole bag of this inside. Oh, thank God. I would love that actually. I'm also gonna say that, that you all have three, like, helpings of Rudebega. I'm gonna give you plus one strength. Ooh. That's great. For, we'll say, 10 minutes. Okay. Is that each of us have three? Or we have three collectively. Three collectively. Okay. Sort of like, quantity of Rudebega. We'll answer that. But only for the next 24 minutes. We'll take the Rudebega. Oh, so we have to use it within the next 24 minutes. Yeah. Okay. Because they're eventually things. Well, should we start heading towards Rudebega? I think so. Let's do it. Oh, my gosh. All right. So we begin our track. We begin our track. We bid dash very well. So we're like, that way. Oh, that's dramatic part of music. Oh, like when we left the worst of ours. Yeah. So, who are our... I would say you're basically right. You're sort of two thirds of the way to the work field. So the roots of part of this like, I would say, almost a day's walk. Okay. No, I'm from my background. But you should be able to make it there by something. Sweet. But you also have to go off path of this one. Oh, okay. Let's go off path. Yeah, off the main road. There's some smaller roads and stuff. So, like, backwards? Yeah. Is this like a wooded road? I guess all that's going to get there. But we're all going to start walking towards the road? Yeah. I'm down. So you sort of leave. And Dash will say, thank you all so much for leaving me with my door. My house. I swear. I'm going to be a good home for now. You're the best job. Did I get a look at bullsh**? Yeah, I wish we could be a tracking device. I like to think you're saying this as we're ripping off the statue. Yeah. You're so welcome. I'm going to take my rope back to tie it up. Oh, yeah. It's good rope. Yeah. That's funny. See, people focus on the recycle, but really we need to be reducing and then using it. Yeah, we just need to show you. All right. So you've head towards the lens, part of it. And as you are traveling in that direction, actually, I'm going to have you, you can all roll or one of you roll, actually one person should roll a survival check. I feel like how well-directionally. That's nice. That's nice. That's nice. That's nice. That's nice. Well, okay. Go for it. Well, could we both get guidance to the acrylic? Yeah, okay. I don't know if I can stand. I'm just getting stuck. I don't think it's stacked. Okay. Don't worry about that. All right. Good to go, guys. Thank you. Sweet. Okay. 19 plus a d-dolter. Okay. I'm going to have to do that. Okay. 21. This is pointy. Yeah, it's dark. It's short. Cool. So you, I'll say you get the rinse of part of, uh, by sundown. So you basically are in a flat plane when you begin. That's where the farmers are all at. So it's just like, um, thank you. Okay. I'm going to lay flat. Um, and then you start going, um, and as your life sort of heading towards the rinse of part of it, one of the population goes down. Like, you're getting pretty sparse and it gets really killing. So it starts to get, um, not like mountainous, but just like sort of rolling hills. And some woods, but also a lot of grasslands. This is what kind of like Kentucky football hills ask. Um, so we're in the back one. And, uh, yeah. So there's these like rolling hills. And we're starting to sort of traverse over them. Um, and you walk over a hill, um, at a certain point. And you think you're getting close. And you spot, uh, in, in like sort of a small valley for a while. Just this heap of bluish stuff. So you just see like the stone, like sort of sprouting up, uh, kind of in the middle of tall grasses. And in that valley, there's not many trees. It's just like sort of rolling grassy hills. Um, and, because in me, you all walk down, you get a little bit closer. Um, you see that the ruins are pretty small. So it's all about like a hundred feet across all the, all the pillars, uh, in stone. Some of the stone is like clearly pillar of life. So looking like it once might have been like a structure. Um, but now it's just sort of seemingly, and random piles on the ground. Just like, it's through and about. Um, and you said it's, what time it is at now? It is like sundown. Oh yeah, should we walk up to the moon? Yeah, it's the moon. How it at, it is now. Okay. Sort of behind it. And I'm actually getting scared. So now, the magic transition. Do you want any snackage? I'm okay. I can eat a lot. Yeah, that would be great. I would. I would. Yeah. Thank you, John. So. Why? Um. Oh, I'm so happy. So I'm going to see what we're about when I can't. I think like kind of like watching for the, uh, like, uh, Damon said, watching for the moon. I think is, uh, put all of your most like, see if something happens. Yeah, I mean, I think we get investigate pillars or like, uh, we're all. Did he say that there was like, loose stone outside? Did you say loose stone? When the root, either ruins the loose stone or is that separate? Okay. Waiting for this to be our also like, when we battle, like on the front side. And I'm a little pumper-nickled chip. I'm a little bit thick. Um. I don't know how to say it. Or a snack for a D&D. I make a lot of different things. I never like the pumper-nickled. I love the pumper-nickled. People who love them are very divisive. I, I used to hate them like pickles. And then now I love them like pickles. Okay. Did they, um, take them out at one point? There's, there's a bag that's just filled with pumper-nickled. Yeah, you can get just that. Like, oops, I'll pumper-nickled. I like the mix. Oh, I like all pumper-nickled chips. I like knowing what I'm gonna get. And that I'm going to like 100% good. What is their season? Well, this is flavor. I don't know. She's like garlic powder. You got a little powder on your powder salt. A little bit, is this sure? Almost. Yeah. It's fine enough that it's not like... What? No, it's sure you're getting a nice snack. Like, when you look at it, you'll see the season. I'm getting conveyor belt. Hmm. I love conveyor belt. I think I heard this one. This was a garlic. I really would. I wanted to punch it before it was. How is that? It was yummy. I went to Delma for the first time. Oh. It was very nice. I was looking happy with it. It's just like a cafe. I got a breakfast plate. And then they're like, and along with greens. And I was like, oh, what does that mean? And it was just kale leaves. Oh, dressed in lemon and oil. And I was like, how do you even massage it? And it wasn't like regular kale. It was like the dinosaur kale. Oh. And I was like, I love kale. But that was just half hazard. Wait, it's not out of town. I need some kale. I like dines for palips soups. But me too. But by itself like that? No, aw. Wait, so the ruins aren't made of blue stone. They are made of blue stone. They're like a blueish stone. Okay. It's like a grayish stone. Do we do any of us like recognize? Like that stone be color. I mean, I guess it's a red. I can roll a nature check. Nature. I love it. Okay, that's awesome. That's awesome. Do we all roll? Yeah. Oh, that is a dirty one. That's a seven. Nine. Very well. It's up to you. I think it's changed. 18. Ooh. Yeah. So it's really easy. This one, the Reliefs has sort of the color of moon stone. Okay. And someone can roll in our comic chat. For everyone who roll in our comic chat, they know it. I love it a guy. 15. Oh, I got a guy. 10. 8. It's a moon stone. We're all just like, ooooh. I imagine someone's like toys from Toy Story. Now you think you've heard from some of your pals. I think that moon stone is called moon stone because it's imbued with an ancient magic such that it glows. Okay. I thought it's a little bit of... But it's so it's a magic object. Yes. Okay. I think cousin Marla was singing, we should maybe set a little campfire while we wait. The moon? Should we wait by it or should we wait up on the hill? Maybe on the hill. Yeah. I like that. You don't know what we're walking into. That's true. I would like to see what happens to the moon stone. On the moon? Like, what is it? We could ask some people up close to us. I'd like to watch. I'd like to be by it. And I'm risk of worse. So even though my name is Cure. I'm too curious. Cure of the Killa is careful with the campfire. Yeah. No, it's careful with the Killa. I'm careful. I'm lying. It's just so good. I'm not as good here. Aww. Thank you. That's good to know. Marla, I'm just curious if this could become a ticketed destination. Nope. Like the honeymoon. Yeah. Ready? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The moon. The moon. The moon. The moon. How big are these ruins? 100 feet across. Yeah. So no. Pretty small. I think it's kind of like a step-pinch. That's actually what I like. And that's where I have to go from. There's pillars. Are there any other types of structures that we recognize? Are we represented as pillars in kind of rubble? None of that you can make out. So y'all are like letting it fire just sort of waiting for the moon. So I think some of us are going to go back up on the hill and kind of observe from a farm. There's anything kind of comes from a distance. I think some of us are going to go up on the hill. Yeah. I'm going up the hill. I'm just going to stay up on the stone boy. Yep. Start up on the hill. Okay. Alright. And who has a... Who has jet? We'll take jet up there. I'm going to say let's not leave him. Yeah. We just let him. I'm going to have to fire him. I'm going to have to fire him. You make that happen. I'm going to kill her. I'm killing him. No. Damn. Sorry. Yeah, too bad. I do read on Reddit. I'm on a DMT. I'm like... I'm killing characters all the time. I'm not today for jet. I'm not today. Not totally. Almost the rest of the time. Two. So some of you are on the hill. Some of you are closer up. So those of you on the hill, you... There's a certain kind of... It gets dark out. And the moon is shining really bright. It's just like super clear, the moon shining bright. And the stone from what you can tell is sort of like almost reflecting the moon like that. So almost like a meter. And so it's like sort of blowing back out. Almost looking like a second moon on the back. And the light isn't like coming as bright off as the moon stone, but it's like very noticeable. And then who's on the ground again? Me and El. So El and Damon, you sort of see this as well. It's almost lit down there like as if it is day. And picture like how bright it is when it's like a first snow. Yes. And you all can roll a perception check. 17. 9. Come along. So El, you're sort of looking just like walking around the stone. And you see one sort of sort of slab that looks like it. It might have writing on it. And tell me what you want to do. Do any of the characters look familiar to me? No. It's a language that if it is breaking, if you don't know. But you also see, I'll say this too, is you see an image that looks like a flame on the stone. And there also looks to be like almost like a map. And a map and a flame. And it has like some arrows. Arrows on the map or arrows pointing to the map. Can I take like an edging of this, like with like a piece of paper and graphite? Like they did in Indiana. I was gonna paper. I was gonna say do a paper. I have... No, I don't have paper. Never mind. I will say. That's a great idea. You can take a smaller stone. Let's see if you can do that. A smaller stone. Like see if you can do an etching in stone. Sure. Yeah. I'll do that. Roller, yeah. Or we could make, we could also make graphite by burning some wood. Can we throw you a piece of paper? That would be great. I have a prayer book so we can just... Yeah. I'm a prayer book. Yeah. Hey, ow! Do you hate paper? That was about any pencils up there. I fold the paper airplane and throw it out. Oh no, that's gonna probably involve a check. I don't think. Well, maps with arrows and a phone. Does anyone have the ability to... Generate a plane? I can, yeah. You can. Give me a roll just like a intelligence check. So give me a roll with intelligence. I'm pretty done. Yeah. You'll let me know if we need a flight. That's a nine. So if you start trying to carve something into another piece of stone, there's always a... There's always a... There's not a half man. Oh damn it. We don't see any enemies or anything. I'm just gonna have fun with the arrow. Nope. Alright, okay. I'll say we go down there. Yeah. We're gonna head down and see what you guys found. I'll call out to them and say, hey guys, I think I found something. I think. They got things. Cool. So you all are sort of looking at this, just like slab. Again, has like this flame in the corner. Has like sort of a layout. Oh, I should also say, I should also say, it looks like there's three floors. To the ruins. To the light map. So it's like sort of one thing here, one thing here, one thing. Oh. On all of them there's sort of like some arrows. Yeah. Like on the map. Three floors on the map. Is there anything that looks like a reference point to where we currently are? Yeah. A moon. I'm sorry. I thought it's as you are here. I thought. Yeah. So what you do see on the top floor, and actually where the longest arrow is, there's this like, so there's sort of like three squareish moving, like sort of floors. But then you see on the top one, just this like long stretch. And you see that, that is like, now that you're looking carefully at it, you can see like a carving of like a hill where that tunnel sort of ends. So there's a hill. So the one in the middle. So that hill is the reference point, maybe. Yeah. Like a hill we go. And it looks like almost like the arrow's going through the hill or through like a tunnel. Is it land on the hill? Yeah, it sort of lands on the hill. So it's on a visible walkway. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Could be a tunnel. Would we see any fire? And like, we look around, do we see any fire points? Or any like areas where maybe like, like, like, the moon shining, like to a certain point or something like that. There are an internal flame. So you can roll, roll, I'll be rolling for some. I'm going to go sexually. Not good. I'm going to go sexually. 21. 13. I got an app 20. Woo! I know. I was like, what's a 5? Yeah, I just need to be on top of the moon. So Damon and Crill, both of you are able to make out clearly the like, hill that is on the slab. You're like, well, that looks like that one on the top. Yeah. Over the under. And Crill, you can see on the bottom of that hill, it looks like there's like a little bit of like, sunken earth. Okay. It looks like a little bit kind of weird from there. You just like have these like, all guys just like, I don't know what it is. Hey guys, I think there's a bit of sunken earth that had a base of the hill. Wow, good job. Thank you so much. Let's go check it out. Yeah. Let's go. I do want to retry. I'm going to take out my prayer book and try and do an etching of the map if I can. I'm going to have to have like, assist you with that. I have one carter's tools. I don't know if that helps. I have paper. I'm inventing activities and events. Oh, like graph animals. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I have a disguise kit. So I'm going to take out some of my, it would be fair to say in disguise kit, I have some like, coal eyeliner or something. That's a make out for something. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So I'm going to take some eyeliner out of my disguise kit and rub it to get some coffee of the color. Cool. Roll. Just the intelligence check again with disadvantage. With disadvantage, okay. Can I give you guidance on that? Sure. What do I get for that? D4. I'm going to put my end up in the dust. That's just a good question for you. And then that's going to be nine with guidance. Oh, it's a nine. So you attempt to recreate the map, but given the tools that are in your disposal and sort of how weathered the original is, the sort that comes up, like not, it's just helpful. So we've kind of looked at the top floor. What do we see on the other two floors? So the top floor and the middle floor look, there's sort of several rooms. It looks light. And some stairs. And on the bottom floor, there really isn't anything except for the stairwell. So you just see the stairwell going up, otherwise it's just sort of empty. And is there anything in any of the rooms or any notes? It's just kind of like a map of empty rooms. It's kind of like a map of the bedrooms. And you said on the top floor of the map is the hill that we recognize, right? Yeah. Got it. Where's the fire symbol placed again? Unlike the top right hand side of the slide. Okay. Can we, you said you got some fire, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, of course. So I can do... Oh, it's a bomb. It's a bomb. It's a bomb. It's a bomb. It's a bomb. It's kind of super bomb. It says you cause flames to flicker, brighten, and then you can just do it or change it. I don't know what that means the flames can already be there. We could like... I have a tunnel. Yeah, I have a tunnel. I'll start a little fire. And then I'll cast on the torches. Yeah, I'm tender. I'm torched, too. Oh, yeah. Perfect. Yeah, so I'll cast the liturgy on the flame. Cool. To see what happens. So, you start this little fire. Damon makes it like... Well, bigger with the amateur scene. It sort of expands and nothing happens. Oh, no. I'm sorry. I won't do that again. You know, when it's like in Zalda when you're cooking something and you're really excited, it's like, and then it's like something bad. Yeah. So I'm like thinking there, I'm like, oh, I'm gonna make a pie. I know. It's like you put a wrong ingredient in there. So there's... Guys, I think we should just go to the sunken earth. Yeah, let's go there. Because then maybe we'll figure out what's on the second floor of this map. Yeah. Yeah. Sunken earth. Sunken earth. Maybe. How many rooms are there on each floor? Just before we leave the map. About five. There's five on each floor. Each of the top middle and top floor? Yeah. Five rooms. Do they all look about equal size? No. Just sort of different size. What? What is that? What is that? No idea. Um, I'm hoping my body would do different. Sure. I say we had to wipe your saw, Krila. Great. All right. So you all go up. Uh, to that hill. And you can do it in D.C. this sunken earth. And it feels very soft and mushy. Like in this area. I wouldn't say muddy, but just sort of soft. Hmm. Okay. Can we dig a little bit? Yeah. Do you want to have a shovel? Do I? No, I do not. I have wood grouper tools. If we're still not sure about that. Yeah, I have wood grouper tools. I have a knife, a gouge, and a small saw. A gouge. Oh, like a, a gas. There's not any like hidden doors or anything that we could buy. Or a litigable. You can check for it. Yeah. Can I cast a tech magic? See what kind of magic I'm getting? That's a nanny one. Nice. Uh, uh, Simon is actually convinced. Not only, is there, uh, you suddenly think that you might be on the wrong hill. Thanks, Adam. I think it's that hell for that. Why don't you go check that one out and come back to us. Yes. Yes, Adam's going to do that. Bye, Simon. Bye, Simon. All right, so Simon begins walking away. So the ground, you said the ground is softer. Yeah. I'm going to try it with my hands just dig and maybe like a little town. Same. I'll help you. Yeah. It's still cast a tech magic. Yeah. So, so you definitely get some strong magic vibes. From any particular. Very common or. Specifically from like, so the hill is on like a slighting one, particularly from like, if you were to go almost perpendicular to the hill. Oh, I got it. Okay, I got it. Like that way. Very strong vibes. That's right. You feel like strong? From the bottom. Wait, for the bottom of the hill or. Yeah, like into the hill. Into the hill. Yeah. So like inside the hill. Yes. Oh, okay. Well then, there's got to be an entrance when you're anywhere here somewhere. Yeah. I think it's the sub-dinner. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Whoa. What a great idea that I came up with on my own. Back to the group after I invested in getting and realized that you met. Met. Not as in too many trees. This is tech magic. It could be the school of magic. What's that? This is tech magic. It could be the school of magic. Oh. No, pre, yeah. To see Oras and, um, determine school. School of magic. Yeah. It's due to research. Oh. Actually. And why are you doing that? You're going to figure out how to dig with a dagger. No, I'm not having my solution. Crows like stabbing the ground. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Yeah! Crows like you. Crows like you. Crows like you. Oh. My dad almosticky was mad at me because I wasselve. Good yea. I'mma get you some green grass over there. Ugh, ycாis, look! Actually we got Darver. We still have grass as well. Right. Okay, c'mon now you'll get back down. Little f**king vodka. Miait. My dad, no. This suppose to be. You want that? No. That was dig, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can dig. See you, thank you. Yeah, you're right. I'm gonna cast a summon beast and summon a badger. Ah, chew dig in the wet band. Okay, hell yeah. I'll stop stabbing the grass. So I don't kill the badger. So, the school of magic, you know it's, you're getting some divination. Divination? Okay. What is your name? I don't know. And so all of you start digging and you're not really getting any wood. Okay. But this is ground, you're just going to move to the hands. Or all maybe like six inches to a foot deep. Okay. After maybe like 20 minutes, but siding from that encounters this badger that just f**king starts digging and it's just, it's so effective. It's more like a doll. I'll wait. Okay. I got a new tattoo. Ooh, I'm gonna see it. It's really leaky. It's really leaky. Ooh, I was gonna see it. I was gonna see it. It's a leaky. Oh my gosh, you're right. Is that some feed? Are you right? It's so cute. Oh my gosh, it's so cute. Wait, who's the artist? So I got it drawn up by someone from Portland. The head of the house. Oh, that's so cute. Oh my gosh, I love that. You too. Leg tattoo's hurt. Yeah. They heard a lot. I haven't gotten the leg one yet. Oh, I want it one. Do you need a port of stars to do that up for you? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if I can do this. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We need a port of stars to do that up for you. It's a key. Oh yeah, here it is. This is, I mean on Instagram is crispy ray. You can see ray. Well, but her black work is just so good. And then like the design that I base the top of it was a flash. It was a girl with braids, writing a bunny. And then I was like, oh, so then I just asked her like, hey, can you draw this? Like, so that it's me and my dog. Yeah. And he's like, yes. Okay, I had paid her like 50 bucks. Mm. Yeah, in that toy. I do nothing the best. I was like, I've checked. Yeah. I'm just going to do some one of those. Good vibes. R outside or nature is so chill. I love that. The vibes are really good. It's so good. The vibes are so good. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. They're so good. Okay, we're digging through. So, the batter digs. Yay. I remember about that. And eventually just like, falls in. I remember. Oh. But then like sort of lands like a few feet. Okay. And it does a little blade binding. I like this sort of like hole sort of start to hold right now. And I can either like clear that more now that there's like sort of stuff there where you can just like sort of dive on it. Oh, there's no stairs. No stairs. No stairs. So, but you can tell based on where the batter like, like you can sort of see into the hole and the batter like. It's fine. You can see where the batter was was like a five foot fall. Oh, okay. Yeah. I'm going to like, you can like, like, drop the torch first. I'll go in with it. So it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's going 45 feet. Oh, okay. So, it's not like, is that just like a, yeah. Okay. If it's five feet, this is a pretty small. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I just want me to only land on something. Yeah. Like a, I don't want to like, land. There's nothing at work. You're throwing animals. I think, although he's going to go first with a torch. Pull. So, so side bend you going with the torch and you see sort of nothing. Like, nothing, down, except just like, it's darkness down that way. And it's like a small fall. And then you land on your feet and you're in this like big tunnel. You can't roll for such a show. Oh, Nat 20, baby. Wow. So 25. Do all of you follow? Oh, I guess. Yeah, follow. Mine's a 10. Can I like use my smell though? Oh, because if I smell anything, like any creatures. No, besides the badger. You don't smell any creatures. Besides the badger. Yeah. The badger is still there. Yeah, it's like, is the badger real or? Yeah, it's real. Okay. He'll be around for about an hour. Okay. I'll try to do his concentration. Okay. And then he just, he does a dark vision, though. Yeah. It's an ally. I don't think he can talk, though. So if you run away when you lose concentration. No, I just kind of like, disappears. Oh, okay. Okay. All of you do feel a slight breeze when you come in from the tunnel. Okay. So like this is, um, and, uh, who rolled an apple? I did. So, Al, you also, here in noise, from down the tunnel. And it's just this, like, sort of humming noise that's punctuated by brief causes. Um, and actually since you rolled, uh, you can, it sounds like a cat purring. Oh, okay. But we can't see it. How far is this, how far does this tunnel go back? It's a few hundred, well, you don't know. It just, like, blends into darkness. Okay. Because I have dark vision up to 60 feet. But if it's not going to 60 feet, I probably can't see it. Yeah, still can't. Pictureing like a, almost like a subway train in the tunnel. Yeah. Like when you look back there, it's just, you can tell it's going, but you can't see it all. What are the walls made of? Uh, just like sort of dirt. Like dirt, okay. So it's a natural tunnel. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You guys want to walk down the tunnel? Yeah, let's try this cat. Cool. So, do you start walking down that tunnel? Yeah. Um, and, uh, you go by and it's pretty long. So, you're getting, so about like 500 feet and it's on an incline. So you can tell you what's going down there. It gets cooler. Like all cage lights have these. Sure. You start to sort of, um, and it's pitch black. And it's pitch black. Okay. So we're all holding hands. Yeah, maybe you should all take a torch. Yeah. Who has? I have a dark vision to go like in front. I have dark vision. Do you still have your torch? I do. I just thought of my torch. Okay. I don't have dark vision. I don't need that. So, isn't it all holding each other? Maybe like like elementary school kids, they all hold on to each other. Yeah, we have to take the rope out. So, maybe I'll, like, we can go dark vision in the front. Like, uh, like, you're walking this on. Do you guys want a torch? I have 10 torches. No, let's just see that. I'll do it. Let's see if it's that. Yeah. Alright. Alright. Alright. So you're going down. And at a certain point, those with dark vision, I think they see something moving forward. And it doesn't, it looks like there might be a large object. Just sort of at the end of the tunnel. So you don't get any lights turning in. You just sort of see a large object. Like, it looks like there might be a large object in your way. How big is the object? Large. It sort of, it takes up the entire thing. Okay. Okay. It's walking tunnel. Oh. Can we? Can we take the torch to it and... Yeah, but it needs a flame or something. Oh, I thought we did. Yeah, you can walk out to it. At this point, maybe we do light a torch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So you go. And you see that it's a statue of space made of what kind of... Made of like granite. Okay. And once you get before this statue, all of you sort of hear this, but you don't actually hear this auditory auditory. Tell me. You just sort of get this voice telepathically in your, in all of your heads that says, you who enter this temple, I am its keeper and guard and I shall only let the word they pass. Answer me five riddles and I will let you go by. Oh, really? Whoa. What the fuck is this? Okay. I thought you wore. Sure. You may only, there are V5 riddles and in total you only get 12 guessed. 12 guessed. 12 guessed. Oh, nice. I thought Jude's probably going to get a riddle. Also, we're still holding on the chat, right? Yeah. He's still. We're just going to chuck him down. Are we able to get all five? We're going to get one solid and we get the next. Oh, hey. So they're not on a piece of paper. We get a little word bitey. Yeah. It's like I've prepared this work sheet for you. I got a free ride all this across word. It's at the base of my statue. The second is a word jumbo. Third word all over. Third word all over. Nice. Sweet. Yeah, what's the first one? The first riddle is thus. If you have me, you want to share me. If you share me, you don't have me. What am I? If you share me, you don't have me. Can you put that in the discord? Yeah. If you have me, you want to share me. If you don't have me. I haven't been doing weekly videos. Stop! I haven't. My favorite. He's been prepping. He's been prepping. There's one this test because what is in, what does every corner have one of and every room have two of. The letter L. Oh. Okay. I have me. That's what I was staring at for a while. He said you have me. He said you want to give me. To share me. I said I think it's ice cream. If you don't have me. If you have me, you don't have me. What was it? If you share me, you don't have me. That's right. So what do I wear things that I want to share? Is it a heart? If you share me. I was thinking something like love or like. It's like a heart. If it's like a heart, you know, it gets in your heart longer. But if you have a heart, you share your heart. I want to say, I want to say, you should share it. Oh, is it a secret? Because if you have me, you want to tell people a secret. But if you share it, you no longer have it. I do not have a secret. Oh. Let's go on it. Let's go on it. It's my way. Oh. I know John Vulture. How you doing? I can't see if this is said to be the start and start like it. Oh, we got it. Next, Roodle. The sticks, the mind speaks to you. Yes, that is correct. What is on there? Is that mean we now have a lot of guesses left or? Yes. Okay. So we can make seven mistakes. Hi. Yes. Cool. Okay. We will wait for... You're saying it. I guess if you want to get tight and out through this clip. I don't know. I like to be able to see it. That was good. Good job. Woo! Also, you like riddles? Or you can't get riddles from? Oh, it's just like a... It's like a daily riddle. I just do more. Yeah, it's like the hardest one you've gotten. There was one. I want to make sure I get the word. Did you screen-javit? I did. Because I was like staring at it for so long and I was like, what's that be like the next bit all? Yeah. And the chance goes to be like, I got to change something. What? 2 plus 2? Oh, it's not 4. Oh, it's not 4. Oh, it's not 4. It's not 4. It's not 4. It's not 4. It's not 4. It's not 4. It's not 4. This one makes myself swan-rate!29? Daniel Daniel! Wait. Hello, Daniel.

I want to offer one of our guests. Yeah. Yeah, Map feels like a very solid. Is it a map? Map is correct. Yeah! Guys are incredibly in your heads. The next one. I have a room. No, it's a door. Is it a box? Well, the Christmas dolly. I really do hope. I think you have a very specific type of intelligence. Wordplay. You know what? Okay. Riggle number three. What can you hold in your right hand? But number in your left. Oh, what can you hold in your right hand, but number your left hand? What did you hold on to this? You can't hold your left hand in your left hand. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've heard that one before. Did you hold your left hand? That is correct. Wow! You're not a hero, but a risk. Yeah. Maybe if you were like a torsion. Oh, I double-jined. I've heard this joke before, but I was too young to hear that. What do you always use when you speak? But it's not part of your body. Is it your voice? Yeah. That seems right. That's not part of your voice. It's not part of your body. It's not part of your body. It's not part of your body. It's not part of your body. Like your voice. Words. Yeah, words. I like words. Yeah. Do you want to go on? We got it. Words. I'm just accepted. Yeah. We're looking, what have we said, voice? Voice and not have been correct. Okay. What up? Oh. Guys, we're four for four. Yeah. The next one is just going to be using all of our guesses. What is a room? That's a room. That's a room. With a... Take half of cosine times 10. Oh, it was like fuck. The calculus question. The calculus question. The astrology apple. Yeah. Sorry, okay. A chair? And the last riddle. What can fill an entire room without taking up any space?

Sexual tension. Sexual tension. Sexual tension. Sexual tension. Ah. Sexual tension. Sexual tension. Sexual tension. Sexual tension. Sexual tension. If you're going to get into physics. Well, I know. But I don't think that speaks is going to go off and I've heard on us. And be like touch by hand. Touch by hand. Yeah. Oxygen. Yeah, like with air. Air. I feel like. Or does air and says air have multiple volume. Yeah. You can go into physics. I feel like a room. A farm. A feng shui. Oh. A aroma. Right? I feel like a scent. I feel like it needs to be like it. No, I. Love. Emptiness. A black hole. The void. We're going to go with strength theory. Space. My god is actually saying scent. I do feel like I've heard this one before. So scent. Emptiness or air. Like a aroma or scent. Like a scent or air. Like a aroma or scent. Like a aroma or scent. Like a aroma or scent. Like a aroma or scent. I feel like it's light. Or darkness. Oh. Darkness. Let's try darkness. Darkness. You can breath. Damn it! We have four left. Okay, well. I can breathe. Okay. Oh, you have a criminal. What's up? Do you know the answer to this? No, I mean darkness was my second. I'll be doing it. I would argue that all of these are potentially valid answers. They're not the correct answer. Who decides that? I just think you're super mature. Who to make a persuasion check? I don't know. Guys. I really think it's light. Let's try light then. I would be. It's light. The darkness is wrong. That is correct. We love it. We love it. But rescue versus kill. And how do you answer the final riddle? Like close up the riddle. It's shining light from the statue. How cool. And it instantaneously disappears from the view. Sexual attention fills the room. It was sexual attention. It was sexual attention. And once that happens, the entire riddle dungeon is sort of filled with a folded bright moon light. Oh, nice. And you can see at the end of the tunnel, things opening up into a real room. That's what you will be about for next time. Woo!
